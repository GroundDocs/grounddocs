# GroundDocs

GroundDocs is a version-aware documentation assistant. It connects LLMs to trusted, real-time docs—reducing hallucinations and ensuring accurate, version-specific responses.

npx @grounddocs/cli@latest install <client>
```

**Supported clients:** cursor, windsurf, cline, claude, witsy, enconvo, vscode

## 🔧 Manual Setup

To manually configure GroundDocs, add it to your IDE's MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration:

      "args": ["-y", "@grounddocs/grounddocs@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
After configuration, restart your IDE for the changes to take effect.
